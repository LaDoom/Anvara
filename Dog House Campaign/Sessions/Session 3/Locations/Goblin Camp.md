The goblin camp that surrounds the ruins of Tower Volgen rest at the peak of a hill, at the highest point in Volgen's Streach. Surrounded by makeshift wooden walls where campfires burn and drums beat from within, the air is choking with the smell of cooking meat. 

In the middle of the goblin camp is the remains of the tower. Roof collapsed, there is a doorway to a small underground section where Dakan is making his captured slaves dig up the entrance to a temple to Kelgereth (Kel-geh-reff). 

Behind the tower, guarded by a single goblin and his guards are cages containing the slaves that have been captured so far. 

#### Notes

- There are about 12 goblins here total including Dakan. These goblins go out in the evening in groups of 3 soldiers and 1 commando to attack travelers and raid caravans/villages. 
8 - Goblin Soldiers 
2 - Goblin Commandos 
1 - Goblin Chanter
1 - Hobgoblin 

- There are 5 Prisoners here being used as slaves to dig towards the temple of Kelgereth. Two are always digging while three rest. Dakan has a rota so that they will, in turns get to rest two shifts, he sees this as a sort of fairer kind of slavery.

When the players go to the camp roll to see which three is there, Roger will always be there
