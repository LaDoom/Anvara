#### NPCs

- Loup Eaglesend heir of the Eaglesends
  - A confident and generous man, sometimes this comes off as strange and suspicious but his intentions are good. He's an explorer and gentleman at heart.

  - A Colourful woman, aging well with grey streaks in black hair. 
  - Goal: To keep her house safe and serve Tia to the best of her abilities

  - she had hosted two of the carlials, luke some 5 years ago, shortly after she had become head of the house. then a year and a half ago was Kayleigh. 
  - Both were inquiering about Samantha, though she had no contact with the girl her son, Bartholomew had gone to the Conviction Acadamy in the capital, and studied for a year in her class. 
  - if pressed (DC20) she may remember that there was a strange peice of information in an old letter her son sent her, but she will need to have a huge search of the archives to dig out one letter from thousands. 

- Bartholomew 'Mew' Eaglesend, second son of house eaglesend
  - A prim and propper nobelman, well dressed, well presented and haughty. 
  - What he knows:
  - He remembers taking a course inarcane history with Samantha, in truth he had a little bit of a crush on her.
  - He remembers her focus was on some sort of arcane history, so engrossed in his own studies at the acadamy that he never got a chance to get close to her.
  - She was close with a girl at school, a half elf called 'Meylene' who now works as a reasearcher at Conviction. 

  - if the players convince him to help them more, he will offer that if they do a service to the town he will go through his old books and notes for them. if intimidated or thretand he will let them know that he thinks that she was part of a seceret group in the school that formed over the year. 

- Jamie Foxglove, the 'speaker' 
  - An undead revived by the corrupted Tower of Tia, he has a ghastly scar over his face from how he died
  - Goal: To die and be taken to the higher planes by Tia
  - what he knows: 
  When he died he was at peace, and saw Tia, the majestioc raven flying down to retrieve his soul. when suddenly they seemed to be held off by some great force.  Then a green flash of light woke him up, moments after he died
  
  He died while out hunting for some boar for his husbands birthday meal, but some sort of winged beast attacked him in the forest, slashed him and he fled. as he died he was calm and accepting. 

  He can feel himself very slowly getting weaker the longer he lives, as if something is being taken from him and drawn to the tower.

  All three of the party glow in a strange way to his eyes, as if there is some strange shinging darkness about each of them. It scares and wonders him, he feels that they are all touched by some strange power.
