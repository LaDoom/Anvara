Before the Arrival and the gods being sealed away, some of the gods bore children, demi gods who would walk the earth, bound to their parents. Many of them were profane and unwealdy, creating empires or becoming warlords. but the restrictions of their parents kept most at bay.

When the gods were sealed away these restrictions were lifted and the children were free to indulge themselves as they wished.
