Tower Volgen was made for two reasons, as a watchpost for the Edlan Empire and a host of troops between Kinrest and Tamella and also as a place of worship and retreat for those who served the god Kelgereth.

The basement of Volgen is a great temple of Kelgereth, the entrance was collapsed by the tremours of the Towers and time. 

it is a mess of vines, vegitation and dryad like monsters who have reclaimed the land in the name of their mother nature.
