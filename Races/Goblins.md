Goblins are tribal creatures that normally savagly attack travelers, some are capable of intergrating into sociaty but not all. 

Goblins can become hob goblins by eating the flesh of many other goblins, but most detest canabalism and seek only to serve their tribe. only those determained to betray their fellows and become the strongest will eat their kind and become a hob goblin.

Hob goblins can also be born through standard reproduction.
