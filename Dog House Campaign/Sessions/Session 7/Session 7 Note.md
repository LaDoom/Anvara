## Locations and Encounters

### House Eaglesend

House Eaglesend is the ruling noble house in the city. They are devoted servents of Tia, famous from before the arrival for being the core breeders and trainers of all the messanger pegions used throughout Edlan and elsewhere. 

The Eaglesend estate is on the north side of the river. a colourfull house, well kept with their banner flowing proudly. On the road to the mansion itself are statues of skeletons in dress from differaint time periods each, differaint, one paints, another reaches down to pluck a flower, one stants with a sword at the ready.

Each of these are memorials for Eaglesend nobility long dead, rememberd as skeletons as a reminder of the fragility of life, but memorialised by what they loved to do. There is a square plot being marked out for the statue of the recently deceased.

The dead mans name is Henri Eaglesend.

### The Houses of Spirit 

#### Lore

The centre of town, sprouting out of the Finger of Tia in the centre of the city. huge,, gothic cathedrals covered in colourful banners and tapestries, depicting the joys of life and many statues of the skeletal saints of Tia. 

### Random Encounters

As the players explore the city roll on the encounter (Or have the players roll a check as they explore 11+ has an encounter happen) table to see if anything happens:

1D6 - 

1 - A man in exaggerated distress stands at the side of the road. “Oh woe is me” he cries, seeking aid from any passerby that will pay him mind. He has written a “letter of love” and wishes for the party to deliver it to a woman who would be located outside the front of a shop they are heading to. He makes excuses that he must leave and cannot deliver it himself. The letter is sealed and cannot be read without breaking it. Upon delivery and after reading it, the woman will attempt to smack the PC that handed it to her. The letter reads “Roses are Red, Violets are Blue, I don’t ever want to see you. Respectfully, Sevantes~”

2 - A doomsday preacher is calling on the streets, that the towers glow calls the end of the world. Some of the Raven Watch will call him down and make him stop as he is spreading fear. 

He will say that they are silencing the truth. 

3 - A person is sobbing on the street, begging to a raven guard to look for her brother, the guard will try to push her away, explaining that the guard are doing all they can. 

If she is asked, they will learn that her brother went missing two days ago after leaving in the night to investigate some strange noises. The guard seem to have done nothing. 

4 - a pickpocket will try to steal from one of the party members at random, roll perception DC 15

5 - A group of 2-3 Thugs are extorting a Noble in an alleyway. If the party intervenes, the standoff can be defused with a successful DC 20 Intimidation/Persuasion check. On a failure, the leading Thug suggests the PCs pay 55gp on the Noble’s behalf and they’ll leave. Anything less is insulting to them and they offer a final warning to, “leave or die”. Initiative begins if the party stays or keeps negotiating. If the party tries to ambush them from the start, the Thugs are distracted and have a passive perception of 7. If only one Thug remains standing, they attempt to flee.

6 - The party comes across a hanging poster depicting a criminal that is wanted dead or alive for various crimes, from theft to murder. This culprit on the run can be placed in a location of your choice as a minor side objective for the party to accomplish. 

### Encounters

- In the night Tia's Finger will glow a bright green and the dead shall rise from the grave. some, mad will attack the living, others will simply hide and try to continue as they were. 

the lady they saw last session will be attacked in the street by her undead wife, if the players help then a raven guard and one of the church of tias clerics will appear and try to take out the undead and then capture everyone involved as to keep what is happaning under wraps. 

2 x ghouls - Wife and daughter

after 2 rounds, a guard and acolyte of tia, searching for the undead will appear, and try to aprehend all of those involved, by force if nessecairy.
