#### Outside

Open tower (Think elder scrolls)

Three floors with stairwells to the sides, one goblin patrols the top.

The second floor is where The goblin Chanter Ophilla resides, performing rituals and healing the other goblins. 
The main floor is used for storage, there are chests and boxes with equipment and loot. most useless but the prisoners effects are here. 

On the main floor is a stairwell decending down towards a door. this has been recently excevated. 

#### Inside

Inside the tower is a wide hallway that has two rooms to the left and right. if the players keep moving forward they will find that it slopes down and that here is where the slaves have been diging away mud, rock and stone. partially revealed is what looks like an engraved stone wall or door. (perception to get an idea that this is infact a door)

On the walls are engravings that are hard to deduce, they seem to depict a figure (religion recognises the symbol of Kelgereth)
