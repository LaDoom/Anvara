#### Galben

The village of Galben lies on the road to Tamella, the river Volgen runs through and the lumber mill that runs here keeps people employed. The town is relatively safe as they pay a tithe to the largest group of bandits that prowl in the the area, but recently a clutch of goblins and their wolves have taken the road towards Tamella. 

Galben was formed about sixty years ago around the Galben family lumber mill, a small little nook of the world that hasn't grown or changed much. it used to be much bigger but many of the people have migrated to the bigger, safer town of Tamella.
