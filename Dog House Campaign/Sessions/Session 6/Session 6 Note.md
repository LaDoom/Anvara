#### Things the Party Should know


## Locations

### House Eaglesend

#### Lore

House Eaglesend is the ruling noble house in the city. They are devoted servents of Tia, famous from before the arrival for being the core breeders and trainers of all the messanger pegions used throughout Edlan and elsewhere. 

The Eaglesend estate is on the north side of the river. a colourfull house, well kept with their banner flowing proudly. On the road to the mansion itself are statues of skeletons in dress from differaint time periods each, differaint, one paints, another reaches down to pluck a flower, one stants with a sword at the ready.

Each of these are memorials for Eaglesend nobility long dead, rememberd as skeletons as a reminder of the fragility of life, but memorialised by what they loved to do. There is a square plot being marked out for the statue of the recently deceased.

The dead mans name is Henri Eaglesend. 




#### NPCs

  - Both were inquiering about Samantha, though she had no contact with the girl her son, Bartholomew had gone to the Conviction Acadamy in the capital, and studied for a year in her class. 
  - if pressed (DC20) she may remember that there was a strange peice of information in an old letter her son sent her, but she will need to have a huge search of the archives to dig out one letter from thousands. 

- Bartholomew 'Mew' Eaglesend, second son of house eaglesend
  - A prim and propper nobelman, well dressed, well presented and haughty. 
  - What he knows:
  - He remembers taking a course inarcane history with Samantha, in truth he had a little bit of a crush on her.

  - She was close with a girl at school, a half elf called 'Meylene' who now works as a reasearcher at Conviction. 

  - if the players convince him to help them more, he will offer that if they do a service to the town he will go through his old books and notes for them. if intimidated or thretand he will let them know that he thinks that she was part of a seceret group in the school that formed over the year.
