At the site of the battle the players will find the 5 goblins they killed will have been savaged in the night. most of them with clear parts of their bodies eaten. 

- Nature check says that the bodies were eaten by humanoid teeth, not wolves or any other animals scavenging. 

Searching the area will find a small silver pendent with a broken chain it looks to have been dropped recently (this is Shankas)
