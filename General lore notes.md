Fifty years ago there was a great magical event, out of nowhere, throughout the world great structures erupted from the ground, destroying cities and destabilizing nations overnight these were called The Towers. These towers are mostly unique, and each have strange rules and designs. 

One is a great polyhedron which goes on for miles and miles of impossible geometry, with a humming that drives most men mad. another a great tree that makes healing magic significantly more potent and, once a year be so strong that incurable disease may be healed by the druids who worship this tree. 

The Gods, good and evil had no explination for these Towers, some major religions, less harmed by the arrival have tried to take responsibility for it.

The gods do not commonly comunicate with the people of the world. They are bound to their planes and cannot usually interact with its followers directly. 

Cultures

What sort of cultures would appear when the towers showed up? 

as this happened in a world with existing cultures, the towers havent *allways* been there? or maybe they have, but more appeared?

- In the Mountains where the dragons ruled, a great tower of gold emerged, and from them the dragonborn were born, the dragons, their greed enhanced by the tower, attempted an invasion of the southern lands, taking much into their ownership. An alliance of two nations, one barely recovered by the emergance and another which has been emboldend by the emergance fended the dragons and their army of dragonborn away, taking some but not all land. The dragons were also largely reduced as when the dragons took more territory their greed grew and they civil warred for control of the territory. the Lord of the dragons barely rested control of their land with blood and silver flame.

- In a dark land that was gripped by plauge the tower that emerged was a great disaster that raised the plauge, the land here has been cursed and those who traverse it are filled with peril, rarely do people move through it to survive. 

- The religious capital of a nation had a tower that allowed those who made the great pilgramige through it for five years, five months and five days receave a vision of the future from their god. 

- a great tower decimated a nation by destroying their capital and a large amount of nobility, these nobels adn those of the city were turned into demons and infernals of one of the dark gods, many of the dark gods had great armies mustered into the material world at the emerged. they tore havock across the relm until many of th egods gave up their power to influance the world to lock the demons away with pacts and laws and trap their capital city away in their relms. 

The high elves worship a great god where the law of their race is that they must spend their lives in worship and love of art and expression, living their lives to the fullest and when they reach their prime or their peak they must sacrifice their soul to their god who consumes it for sustinance.
