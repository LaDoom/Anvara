### Backstory

Agatha, Longsnout Ysoki Servant of the Carlisle's 

The Carlisle's live in a spectacular bronze and gold mansion, almost a castle. A black iron fence separates the grounds from the heavily wooded countryside. The grounds contain their own family graveyard, amongst neat hedgerows and a well-kept dark green garden. A large misty inky-black pond, bearing on the size of a lake, with a small dock are also on the grounds, where many of the family hang out during the warmer months. The Carlisle house is rather rectangular, has red carpets and banners scattered throughout, as well as many secrets that few in the family even know about, there are many key-holes that seemingly connected to no door. Marble statues, gorgeous pieces of art and small expensive trinkets are all over the house.

The Carlisle's gained wealth from claiming to own a lot of land that had useful minerals on it, gold, silver, coal, oil. Over generations they became well known within the area, and started to gain notoriety and presence within the local villages, offering services such as public transportation and infrastructure to better the lives of the people living in these villages, whilst taking taxes as payment for them.

The Carlisle's are generally friendly people, and most people have a neutral opinion of them.

Lord Everett Carlisle and Lady Kayleigh Carlisle are the current owners of the estate, continuing to run their business. They are also parents of their children Samantha "Sammy" Alice Carlisle and Luke Carlisle, the future Lady and Lord of the estate. Albert and Edith are the grandparents of the house, having passed down their wealth. Edith is the only grandparent to still be alive, needing extra care.

The family respects the Ratfolk, and calls them by their true name, the Ysoki. Agatha comes from a lineage of Ysoki who have worked for the Carlisle's as servant's and maids - there is a mutual respect between these parties. As Ysoki are actually exceptionally clean, especially when it comes to looking after themselves and their living spaces, they make for good maids. Agatha was adopted by the Carlisle's as a pup, after their previous maid passed away, and was specifically adopted by the oldest child of the family, Samantha.

Agatha was always there for Samantha, from a young age. They grew up together and were quite friendly for a working relationship. Agatha would eventually get to call Samantha by their nickname, Sammy. Agatha would sing songs and play the harmonica for Sammy, keep her entertained, help her sleep with bedtime stories and, help out with schoolwork, cleaning her room, and cooking for her. Anything to meet Sammy's needs especially, while also keeping the rest of the estate in order.

Sammy is definitely Agatha's favourite. Being each other's closest friends. 
Luke is Sammy's younger brother, mostly an adventurer, always playing in the garden and making a mess, but very friendly nontheless.
Sammy's parents always seem quite busy and keep to themselves for the most part, only requiring that Agatha looks after the estate in exchange for a room to stay in and small payments.
Edith, being quite old, requires extra attention and care. Agatha likes hearing the stories that Edith has to tell whilst looking after her, and helps out Edith whenever she can.

As Sammy grew up, eventually she left the house to study in a nearby city for college/university. She was only supposed to be gone for 3 years, however, after 5 years and no contact, the family started searching for her. Year by year, family members would leave to go find Sammy, in turn, disappearing themselves. First it was Luke, in search for an adventure he went out. After a year with no contact from Luke, Everett went out in search for his children. After another year with no contact, Kayleigh went out. Leaving just Agatha and Edith in the house together.

After almost 2 more years, Edith eventually passed away, leaving just Agatha in the house alone. Agatha gave Edith a respectful burial all by herself, and decided it was time to pack up her gear, and start looking for answers herself.
