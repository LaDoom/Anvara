Roger/Rachel (depending on the day) is a wandering knight who tried to kill the Red Claws, a very talented and trained fighter who happens to keep being taken by surprise and captured. They have been building a name for themselves for a year now. it just so happens that whenever the players are involved, Roger keeps ending up in a cage just before they show up. 

They have a magical great sword 'Envy' (called so because all swords need a cool name) that was given to them by their parents. It is attuned to the Shadow Slayers and only works for them or those who know the command word, otherwise it has no sharpness.

They are a member of the Ageless Order, a group of knights who serve the peoples of ht eland, killing monsters and beasts where many countries fail and fall. 

Description: ambiguous features, a relaxed and carefree deminour (think Jeaudeau or sonic). They have black hair with blond streaks. They wear a Purple cloak when they are Rachel, a Red and gold one when Roger.
