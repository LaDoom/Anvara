A person born of the towers is attempting to learn more about them and figure out what his birthright is. he hears a beautiful, alien rythm whenever he is near the towes. 

A religion of the towers is growing in numbers, a nation begning to enter into an industrial revolution, a great prophet has recently died and his dicyples are plotting to wage a holy crusade to spread the faith (they are perhaps also being controlled for a greater purpose)

There is a tower in the capital city of Edlan, Elrith it has a great door with five slots. someone is trying to locate the keys that will open this door. 

Someone is trying to use one of the towers to travel to another plane or open a gate to another plane. (a malicious force is using this to enter into the material plane)

##### Isolated Town

The first adventure has the players being stranded in a remote village with one of the towers in the center. these people worship the tower for it has brought them great peace, the village has seen great luck. it's soil has produced great crops, the people of this town all seem to be in relatively good shape, and a number of them are tall and well built. 

The tower has requested sacrifice, those who enter *feel* its want in their very soul. At first it asked for simple offerings, flowers, then plants, then the blood of an animal, then an animal to be left at it's alter, then for an animal to be killed on it's alter. Larger and larger animals untill it asked for the seed of a mortal be offered, then the blood of a mortal, then the life of a mortal and the town gave them the life of a condemed prisoner, now the tower is asking for the life of a local. 

The town is currently in the begning of a famine, their luck is falling away. wolves have attacked the town, children and the old are begining to fall sick. In the air is a feeling of anger, only some can hear it now, anger from the tower. 

Those in charge of the town who have knowledge and access to the tower have yet to decide who will be sacrificed for the prosperity of the village. many are against the idea entirely while others say that they can give up some of the unsavory characters in town for the betterment of everyone. 

This tower is a great monolith of smooth black stone that ends in jagged, ireggular blocky tips. when one touches it they realise that the stone, though hard, has an unusual pulse to it. In your mind one feels what the tower feels.

In this town it is said that the tower emerged right next to a barn. people from neighbouring villages came and investigated, finding the destroyed barn and the corpses of some of the family that lived in these remote parts. assumed all was dead. 

The beinifital qualities of the tower were noticed and in the fifty years since all people from neighbouring villages have moved here and prospered. 


#### The Child of the Towers

Thirty two years ago there was a great war led by a sorceror king of a small nation in the Lawless streach, this host of all races and some beasts invaded the holy empire, slaughtering its way to a great tower, which was of white crystal. when the king approached he used his great power to force the tower open, a feat never done before. 

the resulting explosion killed everyone, except the king and a young boy who walked out. The young boy is a Child of the towers, formed by the emotions of those who worship the towers, which are representations of ego. This child has grown with the call to open the doors of the great door to the tower in Elrith. he knows not why but only that he must do it. 

It is said that behind the locked door is a pathway to heaven, or that it will grant the wish of those who enter. 

The sorcer king had been investigating a tower in his city when he was given a vision by it, to go and open the crystal tower. nearly destroyed in the explosion, saw in his mind the destruction that the boy would bring and he used his magic and a favour from a devil to rebirth himself. 

In the current day the boy, calling himself Kordeth has opened the towers, which has resonated with those with exceptional skills. he intends to find the keys to open the great gate, but knows that others will do it as well. 

A powerful and influental person, Kordeth commands a cult who worship the towers, has great influance in the holy empire and has been spreading tendrils across the world for the past Thirty two years. he has an ear in almost every court and house of importance across the land, only a few isolated places have been impossible for him to reach. 

The players will feel his influance early in the campaign, once they aquire one of the keys. If they have already worked against him, which they would have in some way.
