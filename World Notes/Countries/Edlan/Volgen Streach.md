The Volgen Streach is the land between Tamella and Kinrest where the River Volgen runs through. 

This land is essentially ran by the Silk Arrows, a bandit group who extorts the towns and villages around the streach. Paid by Tamella to ensure that merchants can come and go without damage from other bandits or monsters.
