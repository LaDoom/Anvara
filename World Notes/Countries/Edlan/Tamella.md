The town of tamella is in the country of [[Edlan]], a Southern country that fell into ruin during the collapse. the roads are generally unsafe and rulership has been poor.

the town itself is relatively safe due to the guards, a group known as the Raven Watch, refered to as 'The Watch'.

There is a group of bandits around the village who have been causing trouble with them and a few other towns in the region. The recources of the closest city cannot be spared to deal with them. 

in the middle of town is a tower, formed from a chapel of the god of death. a huge rectangular spire, segmented and gothic with arches and looming depictions of the goddess.

The city is colourful and alive, though the area that they live in is harsh the people here take a joy in life, because of the presence of the god of death, Tius the bird. 

*History*

It was said that the tower itself, a clear sign of the god led to many of the faith to this great place. Here the devoted comunity has prospered, led by the Church of Tius and their backers, House Eaglesend.
