The Red Claws are a tribe of goblins from deep in the caves around Volgen, The tribe was formed by the Hob-Goblins Dakan after he fled his own tribe and turned to worship of Haa. 

Their greatest treasure was a Blue Orb that shimmerd with lightning that Dakan treasured. an explorer going to Fort Volgen found a staff that worked with the Orb and Dakan, seeing the staff in the orb, sought to bring them together to wield great power. 

Him and his tribe assulted the adventurer as he was on his way to Tamella. The staff, which invigorates his allies, made him dream of being the biggest baddest tribe. much better and fairer then his old tribe of Hob-Goblins. He and his Red Claws have set up a camp in the tower and have began pillaging and raiding other settlements. 

The staff is an anchient artefact, blessed by Kalgereth, it was once used to manage the weather and allow the people of the Volgen streach to flourish. long lost even before the arrival. It allows the unattuned to have minor power, increasing the power of their allies and summoning small lightning bolts. in the right hands it could turn the tide of a war.
