- Learned that each of the party members have a strange aura about them, Gor'ion is the least effected but it is still there. 
- Agatha seems to have the most 'aura' about her
- got Devias the head priest to perform an exorcism on her, in her dreams Devias was being held off by some great blackness. in the distance the voice of Sammy tried to break through, only getting the sylibal 'Vah'
- Party went to Tias Finger to try to further investigate and the door opened at their presence, then a great skeletal bird flew out. 
  


#### Things the Party Should know


## Locations and Encounters



### The Houses of Spirit 


#### Encounters

Undead attack

There are 2x skeleton Guards and a skeletal eagle created by the necromancer to guard the entrance if anyone were to get in. 

there are other skeletons that will come out and attack people surrounding the tower, keeping the raven guard occupied. 


#### Lore

The central district in Tamella surrounding the central tower, where the church of Tia resides. Funded by the Eaglesend noble house and the many worshipers of the god, it is a very powerful institution. 

The district is of huge, gothic cathedrals and buildings, houses of healing, schools and churches covered in colourful banners and tapestries, depicting the joys of life and many statues of the skeletal saints of Tia. . 

#### NPCs

- Jamie Foxglove, the 'speaker' 
  - An undead revived by the corrupted Tower of Tia, he has a ghastly scar over his face from how he died
  - Goal: To die and be taken to the higher planes by Tia
  - what he knows: 
  When he died he was at peace, and saw Tia, the majestioc raven flying down to retrieve his soul. when suddenly they seemed to be held off by some great force.  Then a green flash of light woke him up, moments after he died
  
  He died while out hunting for some boar for his husbands birthday meal, but some sort of winged beast attacked him in the forest, slashed him and he fled. as he died he was calm and accepting. 

  He can feel himself very slowly getting weaker the longer he lives, as if something is being taken from him and drawn to the tower.

  All three of the party glow in a strange way to his eyes, as if there is some strange shinging darkness about each of them. It scares and wonders him, he feels that they are all touched by some strange power.  

- Devias, head priest of Tia
  - An elf devotee of Tia, made a pilgramege to the city shortly after the Collapse and has been here since, rose through the ranks and has been recently (5 years ago) made the head priest. 
  - Goal: Keep the peace in Tamella, keep the autority of the church and reduce chaos in this crisis. find out what is going on without causeing the most panic and destruction. 
  - Personality: Reasneoable but dosen't really have a sense of humour.
