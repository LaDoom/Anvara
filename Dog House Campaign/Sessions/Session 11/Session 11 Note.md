  - Goal: To die and be taken to the higher planes by Tia
  - what he knows: 
  When he died he was at peace, and saw Tia, the majestioc raven flying down to retrieve his soul. when suddenly they seemed to be held off by some great force.  Then a green flash of light woke him up, moments after he died
  
  He died while out hunting for some boar for his husbands birthday meal, but some sort of winged beast attacked him in the forest, slashed him and he fled. as he died he was calm and accepting. 

  He can feel himself very slowly getting weaker the longer he lives, as if something is being taken from him and drawn to the tower.

  All three of the party glow in a strange way to his eyes, as if there is some strange shinging darkness about each of them. It scares and wonders him, he feels that they are all touched by some strange power.  

- Devias, head priest of Tia
  - An elf devotee of Tia, made a pilgramege to the city shortly after the Collapse and has been here since, rose through the ranks and has been recently (5 years ago) made the head priest. 
  - Goal: Keep the peace in Tamella, keep the autority of the church and reduce chaos in this crisis. find out what is going on without causeing the most panic and destruction. 
  - Personality: Reasneoable but dosen't really have a sense of humour.
