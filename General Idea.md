Players all find themseleves in a town when they are drawn to a tower, at the begining they all find themselves in the same place when a group of local bandits attack. then at the inn they are staying at they are each in rooms right next to each other. In the night the tower emits a great green glow. all of those in town are returned but strange and aggressive. and those who were close to the tower have been changed by it, all in bizzare strange ways. 

The tower is that of a great temple, formed out of an old cemitairy of the moon goddess of death. Trapped, and with monsters. The players must reach the top of the stairs but there are the ghosts of two families there who are bitter rivals. the stairs upwards are guarded as the elder of the family that lives there wishes to roam the floors in peace. 

At the top of the tower is an artifact that, when the players touch it they see one of the towers in a great city, an intricatre door with five holes, infront of the door is a figure, stoic man in elegant armour. 

When they approach the towers they can enter it but others cannot.
