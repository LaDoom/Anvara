#### The Road to Tamella

The road to Tamella runs from the town of Kinrest, through the village of Galben, as they travel to Galben they will see a tower in the distance, past the village, one of the landmarks for the route to the town. 

Survival checks will avoid some traps laid on the road and tell the players that there seems to be signs of small humanoids. (Maybe stumble across a destroyed camp or cave with a dead goblin and traveller)

##### Encounters 

The players are locked in the back of the wagon they were traveling on (DC 15). On the outside they can see the camp through the slats of the windows. four bandits are making camp, one close to the wagon, one tending a fire and two keeping an eye on Felix. 

The players equipment is in a pile next to the fire. 

The bandits are planning on giving Felix to some nobles who want him dead for a hefty reward. the only one who knows who the contact is would be the leader of the bandits Eddie.

Listening in on the bandits they will hear that they are worried about goblins in the area and that they are thinking of selling the animal folk to slavers in the Lawless stretch.

The village of Galben lies on the road to Tamella, the river Volgen runs through and the lumber mill that runs here keeps people employed. The town is relatively safe as they pay a tithe to the largest group of bandits that prowl in the the area, but recently a clutch of goblins and their wolves have taken the road towards Tamella. 

Galben was formed about sixty years ago around the Galben family lumber mill, a small little nook of the world that hasn't grown or changed much. it used to be much bigger but many of the people have migrated to the bigger, safer town of Tamella.

The middle aged woman is a hero of the town, having negotiated their saftey when neither Tamella or Kinrest could. She wants the goblins dealt with and will happily pay anyone who will get rid of them.
