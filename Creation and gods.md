### Creation Myth

The world was made by the god Ven, a primordial chaos from which the other gods were given life.  Their parent, blind and thoughtless. rambling in thoughts far above its children.

its children decended from their plane to the material world and brougt life to the sentiant races from the planet that had grown there, silent in the chaos. 

The races of the world grew, warred and coexisted. kingdoms rose and fell for thousands of years. while the world was on the cusp of change The Arrival happened. Across the world great structures rose from the ground. each differaint and with no set rules. Great polyhedrans that influanced the ground around them, or structures of bone that the undead poured out of, these spires came to be known as The Towers. 

During the arrival the world fell apart, monsters emerged from the dark, kingdoms fell and dragons attacked. 

As this happened The demon lord of Chaos Aeruthas-Van, invaded with his servents and destroyed much of the middle of the world while most of the inhabitants were winded by the towers emergance. One of the gods, lord of moonlight Noctis, one of the few who were purely nobel, forced a ritual that bound him and many of the gods away. those who were allied or tricked by him were more perminantly detached from the world where those who were not can still interact with the material plane, though distant. 

The towers themselves were born by Ven who, rambling and quiet in its madness, made manifest the concepts and emotions of places or people in the world.
